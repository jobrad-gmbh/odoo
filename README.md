# ⚠️ Updating Python dependencies

Be aware that when working with `pyproject.toml` file you also have to update `pyproject.toml` in our
[odoo-addons-jobrad](https://github.com/jobrad-gmbh/odoo-addons-jobrad) repository.

[`jobrad-gmbh/odoo-addons-jobrad/pyproject.toml`](https://github.com/jobrad-gmbh/odoo-addons-jobrad/blob/develop/pyproject.toml)
is a **superset** of
[`jobrad-gmbh/odoo/pyproject.toml`](https://github.com/jobrad-gmbh/odoo/blob/jobrad-14.0/pyproject.toml) which means
that the group `[tool.poetry.group.odoo.dependencies]` is present in both of the files. This is a consequence of us
versioning projects and their sets of dependencies instead of Python packages. Since we are "gluing" repositories
together, their `pyproject.toml` files have to be in sync.

The process of updating
[`jobrad-gmbh/odoo-addons-jobrad/pyproject.toml`](https://github.com/jobrad-gmbh/odoo-addons-jobrad/blob/develop/pyproject.toml)
has been automated through
[`scripts/python_environment/update-pyproject-toml.py`](https://github.com/jobrad-gmbh/odoo-addons-jobrad/blob/develop/scripts/python_environment/update-pyproject-toml.py).
In order to run the script, you need to have Python and Poetry installed. The script updates
`[tool.poetry.group.odoo.dependencies]` group and runs `poetry lock` for you. If you want to see how the new
`pyproject.toml` will look like without actually updating it, you can specify `--dry-run` flag.
